# MyCoucou — guide for AI coding agents

MyCoucou is a native macOS app (`NotchBuddy/`). Mochi, a small animated character living in the MacBook notch, shows AI coding agent sessions (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity and more) and a few integrations, and lets the user approve, answer and chat from the notch.

## Where things are
- `NotchBuddy/Sources/App/` — Mac-only Swift code. `NotchBuddy/Sources/CoucouKit/` — shared models, pills, diff, Mochi engine. `NotchBuddy/Resources/sounds/` — the 28 WAV sounds.
- `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` — behaviour, views, states, integrations (in French).
- `design/prototype/notch-buddy.html` — original prototype, the visual source of truth. `design/captures/` — target screenshots.
- `tests/` — Swift unit tests runnable via `tests/*.sh` wrappers.

## Build
```
cd NotchBuddy && xcodegen && xcodebuild -scheme NotchBuddy -configuration Debug build
```

## Rules
- Swift 6, SwiftUI + AppKit. No third-party dependencies unless truly unavoidable. The character is drawn in code (`Canvas` + `TimelineView`), no Rive/Lottie/images.
- Secrets live in the Keychain, never on disk or in git.
- No telemetry. Network calls only to services the user configured.
- Never block Claude Code: if the app doesn't answer, the hook exits immediately.
- Never overwrite `~/.claude/settings.json`: dated backup, merge, show the diff, write only after the user confirms.
- Never send an email or approve a Claude Code or Codex permission without an explicit click.
- Performance: 0 % CPU when the island is hidden.
- Keep the bundle identifier `fr.louisraille.NotchBuddy` (Keychain items, preferences and permissions depend on it).
- Never restyle what already ships (pills, cards, Settings, chat…): existing views stay exactly as they are in `main`, which is the App Store build. Change the look of an existing view only when explicitly asked.
- Pill IDs are stable contract values (Keychain, UserDefaults, hook routing): never rename an existing pill ID.
- New views follow the existing app style. `design/prototype/notch-buddy.html` and `design/captures/` are references for new work, not a reason to change existing views.
- Every release adds its CHANGELOG.md section, a row in the README Versions table, and commits the regenerated Info.plist with the new version.
